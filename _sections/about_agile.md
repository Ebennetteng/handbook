“Agile” is a term that can be applied to software development or project management. It’s a way of working that is iterative, incremental, and highly interactive. Users are engaged from the start and throughout the project. Tasks are prioritized and completed in short sprints of work (usually two weeks in duration). 

The Agile Manifesto was compiled by a group of brilliant programmers who believed strongly in the need for an alternative to traditional, documentation-heavy, “waterfall” development (in which a software project is planned for months or years, and then launched -- often over-budget and sadly lacking in features that are of value to users.)

Agile principles have relevance beyond software development. When an organization adopts agile, it fundamentally changes its culture to be more collaborative and responsive to change. 

__Agile Manifesto__

“Through this work we have come to value

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
- Working software over comprehensive documentation 
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.”
