Agile focuses on small teams that are cross functional to deliver incremental value using iterative methods. These Agile teams can work on smaller projects however for programs that encompass large enterprise projects a number of methodologies have been created to extend these Agile concepts to work at the Program and portfolio level. The following frameworks are being used by organizations to execute projects whose scope exceeds that for a single Agile team:  

**SAFe:** This is a prescriptive framework that uses core Lean and Agile concepts like cadence and incremental value delivery to scale Agile to multiple teams. Multiple teams are part of an “Agile Release Train” (ART) that have cadenced development activities called a Program Increment (PI). The team's use 2 week Scrum for development while the PI’s aggregate these up to the Program level allowing the teams to plan and demo larger components together in 3-5 months. SAFe also takes a flexible scaling approach allowing it to be tailored for medium to large organizations.  

**LeSS:** Large Scale Scrum (LeSS) scales up defined Scrum activities by including up to 2 members from each team for a second team-of-teams meeting, a “overall retrospective” and additional coordination and communication activities like town hall meetings among others.  

**DaD:** The Disciplined Agile Delivery framework tries to include a planning phase to address all aspects of solution delivery including decisions on platform, build tools, scheduling and other challenges while utilizing existing Agile methods like Scrum.  

**DSDM:** Dynamic Systems Development Method is an iterative and incremental methodology that fixes cost, quality and time at the beginning, and prioritizes scope into musts, should, could and won’t haves (MoSCoW) to meet the constraints. Like DaD DSDM also uses a planning phase prior to the start of the project.
