Agile relies on small, cross functional teams to deliver incremental value using iterative methods -- perfect for small or mid-size projects. However, for large enterprise projects, a number of methodologies have been created to extend the concepts of agile to work at the program and portfolio level. The following frameworks are being used by organizations to execute projects in which the  scope exceeds the capabilities of a single agile team:

+ **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)**: A prescriptive framework that uses core Lean and Agile concepts (like cadence and incremental value delivery) to scale to multiple teams. The teams are part of an “Agile Release Train” (ART) and perform cadenced development activities, which are aggregated up to the program level, allowing teams to plan and demo larger components in 3 - 5 months. 

+ **Large Scale Scrum (LeSS)**: Scales up defined Scrum activities by including up to two members from each team for a second team-of-teams meeting, an “overall retrospective” and other coordination and communication activities like “town hall meetings”. 

+ **Disciplined Agile Delivery Framework (DaD)**: A framework that includes a planning phase to address all aspects of solution delivery including decisions on platform, build tools, scheduling, and other challenges while utilizing existing agile methods like Scrum.    

+ **Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)**: An iterative and incremental methodology that fixes cost, quality, and time at the beginning, and prioritizes scope into must, should, could, and won’t haves (MoSCoW) to meet the constraints. DSDM also uses a planning phase prior to the start of the project.
